Very simple smoke test.

This should yield the same output as test_output.tsv.  Depending on the python
implementation you may need to sort output to properly compare.

This should yield the same output as test_output-m.tsv.  Depending on the
python implementation you may need to sort output to properly compare.

    keggannot_genes2ko -m kegg test100.blast7.tsv.gz

These blast results are based on a blastp (1e-5 cutoff) of test100.fasta.gz
against the KEGG peptide database as of 2013-06-24.
